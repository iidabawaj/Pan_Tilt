# Pan_Tilt
Task 2 of the Mechanical Engineering path

## Pan and Tilt Movement
The pan and tilt movement refers to the rotational motion of a robot head or camera along two different axes: the horizontal axis (pan) and the vertical axis (tilt). This movement allows the robot head or camera to scan and explore its surroundings in a wider range.

Pan Movement: Refers to the rotation of the robot head or camera horizontally from side to side. It allows the head or camera to turn left or right, scanning the environment in a sweeping motion. The pan axis is typically aligned with the horizontal plane, allowing the head to pan from left to right or vice versa.

Tilt Movement: Refers to the rotation of the robot head or camera vertically, typically along the perpendicular axis to the pan axis. It allows the head or camera to tilt up or down, adjusting the viewing angle vertically. The tilt axis is aligned with the vertical plane, enabling the head to tilt upwards or downwards.

## MG996R Servo Motor

![MG996R](https://github.com/iidabawaj/Pan_Tilt/assets/139181626/4bc87fb0-ebd2-44fd-9f7e-93413dd62f8e)

The MG996R servo motor is a commonly used servo motor in robotics and hobbyist projects. It is a high-torque motor with precise control and is often preferred for applications that require strong and accurate rotational movement.

The MG996R servo motor offers a high torque output, which means it can exert a significant amount of force to rotate objects or mechanisms. This high torque capability makes it suitable for applications that require moving heavy loads or overcoming resistance. It typically has a rotation range of 180 degrees, which means it can rotate from 0 degrees (fully counter-clockwise) to 180 degrees (fully clockwise). This range can be adjusted or modified in some cases.

### The use of 2 MG996R Servo Motor
* By using two servo motors, one for the pan and one for tilt, each axis can be controlled independently. This allows for simultaneous movement along both axes, providing a wider range of motion and flexibility in positioning the robot head or camera.

* Helps distribute the load and weight evenly. This improves stability and reduces the chances of the head or camera tilting or sagging due to an unbalanced load.

* Each servo motor can be controlled with precision, allowing for accurate positioning and fine-tuning of the pan and tilt angles. This is particularly important in applications such as surveillance systems or camera tracking, where precise control of the viewing angles is crucial.

## Brackets
## U-type Servo Bracket

The U-type servo bracket is a mechanical component used in robotic systems for mounting and supporting servo motors in the pan and tilt movement configuration. It is named "U-type" due to its resemblance to the letter "U" in its shape.

It serves as a vital mechanical component in pan and tilt systems, providing a sturdy and adjustable platform for mounting the servo motors. Its design enables precise positioning, stability, and ease of integration, making it a popular choice for implementing pan and tilt movements in various robotic applications.  

## Multifuntional Servo Bracket

The multifunctional servo bracket is a versatile mechanical component that is used in robotic systems for various applications involving servo motors. It is designed to provide flexibility and adaptability in mounting and positioning servo motors in different orientations and configurations.

Using a multifunctional servo bracket with pan and tilt movements provides versatile mounting options, adjustable positioning, stable support, integration with other components, and customization possibilities. These benefits contribute to the successful implementation of pan and tilt capabilities in robotic systems, enabling precise and controlled movements for various applications.

## Ball Bearing

A ball bearing is a mechanical component used in many systems, including those involving pan and tilt movements. It consists of two rings, an inner ring, and an outer ring, with small metal balls sandwiched between them.

Ball bearings are used with pan and tilt movements to reduce friction, distribute loads evenly, provide axial and radial support, and enhance the longevity and reliability of the mechanism. They enable smoother, more precise, and more durable motion in pan and tilt systems.
